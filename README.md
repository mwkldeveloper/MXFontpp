## Prerequisites

* **Python > 3.6**

  Using conda is recommended: [https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/linux/](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/linux/)
* **pytorch >= 1.5**

    To install: [https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
    

* sconf, numpy, scipy, scikit-image, tqdm, jsonlib, fonttools

```
conda create -n mxfont python=3.11
pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu129
```

```
conda install numpy scipy scikit-image tqdm fonttools
pip install sconf einops jsonlib-python3
pip install -U Pillow==9.5
```


# Usage

Note that, we only provide the example font files; not the font files used for the training the provided weight *(generator.pth)*.
The example font files are downloaded from here. The ckpt can be found in [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1x1DahG0ilAnbL-8o6mq_C2fMas_udpYq?usp=drive_link).

## Preparing Data
* The examples of datasets are in *(./data)*

### Font files (.ttf)
* Prepare the TrueType font files(.ttf) to use for the training and the validation.
* Put the training font files and validation font files into separate directories.

### The text files containing the available characters of .ttf files (.txt)
* If you have the available character list of a .ttf file, save its available characters list to a text file (.txt) with the same name in the same directory with the ttf file.
    * (example) **TTF file**: data/ttfs/train/MaShanZheng-Regular.ttf, **its available characters**: data/ttfs/train/MaShanZheng-Regular.txt
* You can also generate the available characters files automatically using the `get_chars_from_ttf.py`
```
# Generating the available characters file

python get_chars_from_ttf.py --root_dir path/to/ttf/dir
```
* --root_dir: The root directory to find the .ttf files. All the .ttf files under this directory and its subdirectories will be processed.

### The json files with decomposition information (.json)
* The files for the decomposition information are needed.
    * The files for the Chinese characters are provided. (data/chn_decomposition.json, data/primals.json)
    * If you want to train the model with a language other than Chinese, the files for the decomposition rule (see below) are also needed.
        * **Decomposition rule**
            * structure: dict *(in json format)*
            * format: {char: [list of components]}
            * example: {'㐬': ['亠', '厶', '川'], '㐭': ['亠', '囗', '口']}
        * **Primals**
            * structure: list *(in json format)*
            * format: [**All** the components in the decomposition rule file]
            * example: ['亠', '厶', '川', '囗', '口']


## Training

### Modify the configuration file (cfgs/train.yaml)

```
- use_ddp:  whether to use DataDistributedParallel, for multi-GPUs.
- port:  the port for the DataDistributedParallel training.

- work_dir:  the directory to save checkpoints, validation images, and the log.
- decomposition:  path to the "decomposition rule" file.
- primals:  path to the "primals" file.

- dset:  (leave blank)
  - train:  (leave blank)
    - data_dir : path to .ttf files for the training
  - val: (leave blank)
    - data_dir : path to .ttf files for the validation
    - source_font : path to .ttf file used as the source font during the validation

```

### Run training
```
python train.py cfgs/train.yaml
```
* **arguments**
    * path/to/config (first argument): path to configration file.
    * \-\-resume (optional) : path to checkpoint to resume.


### Test

### Preparing the reference images
* Prepare the reference images and the .ttf file to use as the source font.
* The reference images are should be placed in this format:

```
    * data_dir
    |-- font1
        |-- char1.png
        |-- char2.png
        |-- char3.png
    |-- font2
        |-- char1.png
        |-- char2.png
            .
            .
            .
```

* The names of the directory or the image files are not important, however, **the images with the same reference style are should be grouped with the same directory.**
* If you want to generate only specific characters, prepare the file containing the list of the characters to generate.
    * The example file is provided. (data/chn_gen.json)
    
### Modify the configuration file (cfgs/eval.yaml)

```
- dset:  (leave blank)
  - test:  (leave blank)
    - data_dir: path to reference images
    - source_font: path to .ttf file used as the source font during the generation
    - gen_chars_file: path to file of the characters to generate. Leave blank if you want to generate all the available characters in the source font.

```
    
### Run test
```
python eval.py \
    cfgs/eval.yaml \
    --weight generator.pth \
    --result_dir path/to/save/images
```
* **arguments**
  * path/to/config (first argument): path to configration file.
  * \-\-weight : path to saved weight to test.
  * \-\-result_dir: path to save generated images.
